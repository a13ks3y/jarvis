# Jarvis

Just... fuck it.

## Usage

Don't use it.

## Installation

Don't install it.

## Road-map
- Speed-up client build process (taking too much time for now, probably because of heavy assets) 
- ~~Rearrange server and client code (make nestjs app, docs as root for client and move client root to the same (or other) folder)~~
- Add wiki-auto-reading feature. Should look like screencast of random wiki articles browsing (random pieces text
  selections, mouse moves, unnecessary scrolling, following links (only wiki)).
  Selenium or any other solution.
- Encrypted private information (like passwords, photos, etc.)
- Reduce bundle size, optimize words part (using some sort of distributed data-base?)
- Rethink-mind conception, add T-Queue ("Дрочередь"), update back-end logic
- NAT/CORS break-through (in progress, MTProto-approach)
- Agile-like GTD system
- Node script to parse and import notes form Evernote (once and for all). 

### Insights

TDLib and MTProto (or other messengers/communication-channels) could be
used to bypass NAT, store data, schedule and perform some actions, 
using some key-words, tags and patterns from "Saved Messages" and from other chats
as commands.
Also, bot-api can be used to "talk" to strangers (guests in my house for example).

How to manage and control different nodes? In scenario where Jarvis greet someone in living-room (where laptop placed)
he should use those speakers instead of speakers on my phone. Probably some-kind of tabs-kind-of interface, like same
controls, but different tabs - different devices. It should be really flexible, I think it could be any combination of
controls that should/would/need/want/possible/impossible on different devices, that volumes could cross/not cross etc.
