# Jarvis

Just... fuck it.

## Usage

Don't use it.

## Installation

Don't install it.

## Road-map

- Add wiki-auto-reading feature. Should look like screencast of random wiki articles browsing (random pieces text
  selections, mouse moves, unnecessary scrolling, following links (only wiki)).
  Selenium or any other solution.
- Encrypted private information (like passwords, photos, etc)
- Reduce bundle size, optimize words part (using some sort of distributed data-base?)
- Rethink-mind conception, add T-Queue ("Ð”Ñ€Ð¾Ñ‡ÐµÑ€ÐµÐ´ÑŒ"), update back-end logic
- NAT/CORS break-through

### Insights

How to manage and control different nodes? In scenario where Jarvis greet someone in living-room (where laptop placed)
he should use those speakers instead of speakers on my phone. Probably some-kind of tabs-kind-of interface, like same
controls, but different tabs - different devices. It should be really flexible, I think it could be any combination of
controls that should/would/need/want/possible/impossible on different devices, that volumes could cross/not cross etc.
