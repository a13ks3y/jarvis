# Jarvis
Just... fuck it.
## Usage

## Installation

Don't install it.

## Road-map
@todo encrypted items? (why not?)

How to manage and controll different nodes? If I want Jarvis to greet someone in livenroom (where laptop is placed) he
should use thouse speekers instead of speekers on my phone. Probably some-kind of tabs-kindof interface, like same
controls, but diffrent tabs - different devices. It should be realy flexyble, I think it could be any combination of
controlls that should/would/need/want/possible/imposible on different devices, that volumes could cross/not cross etc.
